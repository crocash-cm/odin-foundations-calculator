# Odin Project, Foundations
## Final Project: Calculator
This is my final project for the Odin Project Foundations course. It is a calculator website.
The website was built to strict specifications and could only contain basic arithmetic functions, operate on only two operands in discrete operations.

In the future, I intend to refactor this website to allow sequential calculations and respect the Order of Operations of arithmetic as it does so, but 
presently I continue with the Odin Project.
